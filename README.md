# Threaded-File-Crawler
 The purpose of this project is to allow the user to the number of threads they would like the program to utilize, a string to search for, and any number of files and directories to be searched through. The program will then output the number of times that the string was found within any of the text files, directories, or sub-directories of the passed in arguments. The program utilizes the Pthreads library, and thus it is optimized for POSIX.
